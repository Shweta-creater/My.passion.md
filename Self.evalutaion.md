## How does the formula work?

A formula is an expression telling the computer what mathematical operation to perform upon a specific value. When referring to computer software, formulas are most often used in spreadsheet programs, such as Microsoft Excel. Using formulas in spreadsheets can allow you to quickly make calculations and get totals of multiple cells, rows, or columns in a spreadsheet.
### Excel AVERAGE Function
**Summary**
The Excel AVERAGE function calculates the average of supplied numbers. AVERAGE can handle up to 255 individual arguments, which can include numbers, cell references, ranges, arrays, and constants.
      
      1.Get the average of a group of numbers
      2.Syntax = SUM(COUNTIF(range,"string1")*number1,COUNTIF(range,"string2")*number2)/COUNTA(range)
      3.The AVERAGE function calculates the average of string. To calculate the average, Excel sums all string and divides by the count of numeric values. This behavior can be replicated with the SUM and COUNT functions.

##### Notes üìù:

:black_circle: AVERAGE automatically ignores empty cells and cells with text values(if condition not difine).

:black_circle: AVERAGE includes zero values. Use AVERAGEIF or AVERAGEIFS to ignore zero values.

:black_circle: Arguments can be supplied as constants, ranges, named ranges, or cell references.

:black_circle: AVERAGE can handle up to 255 total arguments.

## How it was implemented

  <summary> Implemented things </summary>
  <ul>
    <br>
    <li> during implement i used SUM function </li>
    <li> during implement i used COUNTIF function </li>
    <li> during implement i used COUNTA function </li>
    <li> during implement i used AVERAGE function </li>
  </ul>
</details>

## Explanation of Implementation

- **The SUM function** adds values. You can add individual values, cell references or ranges or a mix of all three.
- **The COUNTIF function** counts the number of cells in a range, that meets a given criteria.
- **The COUNTA function** returns the count of cells that contain numbers, text, logical values, error values, and empty text (""). COUNTA does not count empty cells.
- **The AVERAGE function** in Excel calculates the average of a group of numbers. The AVERAGE function ignores logical values, empty cells and cells that contain text.


## Test Results

| **SR-No.** | **TEST CASE** | **TEST OUTCOME** | **EXPECTED OUTCOME** | **STATUS** | **REMARKS** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| **1** | Type the Excellent in Punctuality column. | The Value 5 successfully print in average column when I put the Excellent in Punctuality column.¬†| After put the Excellent  in Punctuality column successfully printed the value 5 in the average column. | **Passed** | Testing has been passed |
| **2** | Type the Very good in Punctuality column | The Value 4 successfully print in average column when i put the Very good in Punctuality column. | After put the Very good  in Punctuality column successfully printed the value 4 in the average column. | **Passed** | Testing has been passed |
| **3** | Type the Good in Punctuality column. | The Value 3 successfully print in average column when I put the Good in Punctuality column.¬†| After put the Good in Punctuality column successfully printed the value 3 in the average column. | **Passed** | Testing has been passed |
| **4** | Type the Satisfactory in Punctuality column | The Value 2 successfully print in average column when i put the Satisfactory in Punctuality column. | After put the Satisfactory in Punctuality column successfully printed the value 2 in the average column. | **Passed** | Testing has been passed |
| **5** | Type the Fair in Punctuality column. | The Value 1 successfully print in average column when I put the Fair in Punctuality column.¬†| After put the Fair  in Punctuality column successfully printed the value 1 in the average column. | **Passed** | Testing has been passed |
| **6** | Type the Very Poor in Punctuality column | The Value 0 successfully print in average column when i put the Poor in Punctuality column. | After put the Poor  in Punctuality column successfully printed the value 1 in the average column. | **Passed** | Testing has been passed |
| **7** | **Similarly i Type the ( (Excellent, Very good, Good, Satisfactory, Fair, Poor)  in (Time management,Attendance,Communication,Requirement analysis,Self Learning,Grammatical error and Creativity) columns.** | **The Value (5,4,3,2,1,0) successfully print in average column when i put the (Excellent, Very good, Good, Satisfactory, Fair, Poor) in (Time management,Attendance,Communication,Requirement analysis,Self Learning,Grammatical error and Creativity)** | **After put the (Excellent, Very good, Good, Satisfactory, Fair, Poor)  in (Time management,Attendance,Communication,Requirement analysis,Self Learning,Grammatical error and Creativity columns successfully printed the value (5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0) in the average column.** | **Passed** | **Testing has been passed** |
