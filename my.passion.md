# About myself
My **Passion** is Travel. Travelling helps me connect with new people, which helps to improve my interpersonal skills. 
Travelling makes me *independent* and build my **confidence**. 
The motto of my life is to be determined towards the software world and its development for the betterment in the standard of living of the society.
